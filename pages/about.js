							As you can probably tell by the url that brought you here my name
							is Tristan Southwell. What you probably canâ€™t tell from that url
							is that I am a software developer, an aquarium enthusiast, an
							outdoors adventurer, and a fan of the oxford comma.
							<br />
							<br /> I created this blog as a fun way to share things I have
							learnt, and things I have achieved in my coding adventures, and in
							my aquarium adventures. It will also be fun for me to have a
							record of things I have learned and things I have achieved. It is
							always nice to look at your personal growth and feel good about
							yourself.
							<br />
							<br />
							The blogs are split into two categories. Tech Blog, and Fishroom.
							The titles are pretty self explanatory. Both blogs are a mixture
							of me writing down my thoughts, processes, and journeys, and posts
							where I will break a subject down and explain it. This will be as
							much for my own learning as well as anyone who happens upon this
							page. I love to learn and I love to teach, so this is me just
							living the dream.
